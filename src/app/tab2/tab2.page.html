<p>I am a wife, a sister, a daughter, and a friend. I am a graphic designer, a crafter, and a lover of history documentaries. In the rare moments I am not working or studying, I enjoy quiet moments with my husband and not so quiet moments with our dog Ranger. I was born and raised in Lewiston and received my first degree in advertising from the University of Idaho. I was able to complete my undergraduate degree in three and half years and instead of graduating early, I chose to study abroad my last semester. I lived and studied in Viterbo, Italy for about 5 months. It was an amazing way to round out my college career. I spent those 5 months walking on cobblestones, traveling, laughing with new friends, surviving without comforts of microwaves and cars, getting hit by crazy Italian drivers twice(they were love taps!), and trying to navigate public transportaion in a forgeing language. I wouldn't change one part of that experience for the world. I returned home and a week later graduated, ans spent a nerve racking summer looking for my first post college job. My boyfriend and I moved home to Lewiston in 2016, and in 2017 we finally got engaged after 7 years of dating, buying a house, and adopting a dog together. Now I have decided to further my knowledge by returning to school after 4 years. </p>
